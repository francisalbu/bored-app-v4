For example, when you book a Sunset Kayak Tour in Cascais for €45, you can point your camera at your card to automatically fill in the card number, expiry date, and cardholder name instead of typing manually. This is powered by Stripe's secure payment system and your card details are never stored on our servers.",

For example, you can choose a vacation photo to help activity hosts and other participants recognize you when meeting for group experiences like surf lessons or food tours. Photos are only accessed when you tap Choose from Library.",
        "NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription": "Bored Tourist needs your location to show you nearby activities and experiences sorted by distance from your current position. For example, if you are in Lisbon, you will see Sunset Kayak Tour in Cascais - 25km away so you can easily find activities close to you. Your location data is processed locally on your device to calculate distances and is never shared with third parties, other users, or used for advertising.",
